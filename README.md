# tic-tac-toe

Lots of practice in this one with manipulating the DOM and event listeners. Also working with arrays. Had to think a lot in this project about what order the different functions need to be executed in, and how they all need to be organized within and around each other. 

This project also showed me that I need to pre plan these things out more. It would've gone a lot smoother.
